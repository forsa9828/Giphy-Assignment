# Giphy-Assignment

Unit 6 AJAX & API

In this assignment we are using AJAX to access a GIPHY API to make a web page that populates gifs. A  key (API key) is used to access data, provided by GIPHY DEVELOPERS website.  The website created will display 10 still image giphs, as they are called via button. When a giph image is clicked, it will animate. Clicked once more it will return to the still frame. Each giph displayed, will show its rating and additional information about the displayed giph. A form is provided on the page that allows the user to add their own giph topics to the array and print its own button.
